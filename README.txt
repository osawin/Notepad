This is an application to write and store notes.
It has two modes - viewing a list of notes, and editing a note.

While viewing a list of notes, one sees a button to create a new note, and a list of the names of notes.
Creating a new note, or clicking on one of the existing notes, takes one to the editing mode.

In the editing node, one sees 2 buttons, delete and save, as well as two text boxes with the name and content of the note.
Saving or deleting a note takes one to the editing page.
Saving a note saves it to local browser storage. Loading the page again keeps the same list of notes.
